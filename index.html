    This summer I'm doing a 12-week batch at the <a href='https://www.recurse.com'>Recurse Center</a>.

    I used to be a front end engineer at <a href='https://www.ngpvan.com'>NGP VAN</a>, building clean and usable interfaces for progressive organizations. Before that I was a web developer at coworking startup <a className='link' href='https://cove.is'>cove</a>.

    Prior to programming, I studied international politics. I would love to talk to you about using the web for social justice and social good.
