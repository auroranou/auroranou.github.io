    Hi, I'm Aurora! I am a front end engineer at <a href='https://www.ngpvan.com'>NGP VAN</a> in Washington, DC, where I create beautiful, usable interfaces for progressive organizations and political campaigns.

  <p class='section__description font-sans'>
    Previously I was a developer at <a className='link' href='https://cove.is'>cove</a>, a DC-based coworking startup. I have also worked in international affairs, conducting research on human rights, international development, and secularism. I would love to talk to you about using web technology for social justice &amp; social good.
